If you'd like to use this program you will need:
- a text editor (I used sublime)
- anaconda installed (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- geopy installed by running "pip install geopy" within anaconda's command prompt
- python installed on your machine

Within anaconda there will be a text editor by the name of Jupyter, open the file by the name of 'finalProject.ipynb' with Jupyter. This will give you access to the data processing code.

To view the visualization code, you can simply open 'index.html' in your designated text editor.

To run the visualization:
- open a windows command prompt, cd into the directory that contains 'index.html'
- run a local server within this location, refer to this documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
- once the server is running go to any browser of your choice and plug localhost:8000 into the url and press enter
